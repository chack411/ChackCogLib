# ChackCogLib and Sample Projects

ChackCogLib is a wrapper library for Cognitive Services builds on .NET Standard 2.0. I'd like to share the source code as a sample of .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Core 2.0 and Cognitive Services.

You can use this library on .NET Core, .NET Framework and Xamarin (coming soon).

Now, the wrapper APIs are only ChackCogLib.Vision.Ocr (OCR of Computer Vision API) and Custom Vision Sample: Noodle Finder. Other Vision API implementations are coming soon.

## This project is:

*   Created as a project for [Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 Preview 6](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/).
*   Built on [.NET Core 2.0 Preview 2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview).
*   Built on [.NET Standard 2.0 Preview 2](https://github.com/dotnet/standard).

## To use ChackCogLib.Vision is needed to setup Azure Cognitive Services API Key:
